# Twitter Bot - Year Done - Reminder that your year is running and you should do something about it!

Out of fun, and seeing other posts, I created a bot that uses tweepy and datetime to calculate the % of the year gone and post into your timeline. Just configure the variables to your desire and the message and post all you want!

## Usage

Just configure the variables inside the script and execute the script.


```bash
python3 twitterbotyear.py
```
